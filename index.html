  <h1 class="post-title">A new democracy for the internet age</h1>

  <p><strong>The Pirate party</strong> stands in the radical centre of British politics. We're part of a global movement of over 40 Pirate parties that are building new democracies for the 21st century on five continents.</p>

  <p>Pirates believe that politics is too important to be left to politicians. We want democracies where everyone has not just a vote but a real voice to make a difference.</p>

  <p>We know that you have to take risks to make waves.</p>

  <p>Sounds good? We'd love you to <a href="{{ "/get-involved" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">get involved</a> and <a href="{{ "/join" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">join us</a>.</p>
